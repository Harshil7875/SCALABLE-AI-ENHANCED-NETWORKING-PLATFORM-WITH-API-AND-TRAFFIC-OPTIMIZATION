### **1. Where Does the Data Come From?**
The project revolves around **network traffic data**, which can originate from multiple sources:

1. **Live Network Monitoring**:
   - Data captured in real time from network devices like routers, switches, or sniffers (e.g., Tcpdump, Wireshark).
   - Data could include:
     - Source and destination IPs.
     - Packet size.
     - Protocol types (TCP, UDP, etc.).
     - Timestamp.

2. **Simulated Data**:
   - If real-world data isn’t available, synthetic traffic data is generated using tools like `Scapy`, or your own script (`attack.py`) to simulate different scenarios like DoS attacks, low-traffic periods, or heavy traffic spikes.

3. **Historical Datasets**:
   - Public datasets, like CAIDA or NSL-KDD, offer real-world network data that can be processed for training and testing.

### **2. What Does the Raw Data Look Like?**
Raw network data is messy, unstructured, and not ready for machine learning. Here's an example of what raw traffic data might look like:

| Timestamp           | Source IP     | Dest IP       | Protocol | Packet Size | Port | Label      |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------|----------|-------------|------|------------|
| 2024-11-23T14:00:01 | 192.168.1.1   | 10.0.0.5      | TCP      | 512         | 80   | Streaming  |
| 2024-11-23T14:00:05 | 172.16.0.10   | 192.168.1.5   | UDP      | 256         | 53   | DNS Query  |
| 2024-11-23T14:00:10 | 192.168.1.100 | 10.0.0.20     | ICMP     | 128         | -    | Ping       |

This is stored in `data/raw/network_traffic.csv`.

### **3. What Do We Need from This Data?**
To make this data useful for machine learning, we need to:
1. **Clean it**: Remove missing, irrelevant, or corrupt entries.
2. **Extract Features**: Derive meaningful attributes (features) from the raw data.
3. **Normalize It**: Scale data to make it suitable for ML models.
4. **Label It**: Add tags like "streaming," "browsing," "attack," etc., for supervised learning tasks.

---

### **4. Data Processing Pipeline**
The **data pipeline** is implemented in the `preprocess.py` script and automates these steps:

#### **Step 1: Data Cleaning**
- **Remove Invalid Entries**:
  - Drop rows with missing or invalid IPs, ports, or protocols.
  - Example: If `Packet Size` is missing, drop the row.
- **De-duplication**:
  - Remove duplicate rows to avoid skewing training data.

#### **Step 2: Feature Engineering**
Feature engineering is the heart of the pipeline. It transforms raw data into structured, ML-ready data. Examples:
- **Raw Features**:
  - Packet size, protocol, timestamp.
- **Derived Features**:
  - **Traffic Type**: Map ports to traffic categories (e.g., port 80 → HTTP, port 443 → HTTPS).
  - **Packet Rate**: Number of packets per second (helps detect DoS attacks).
  - **Data Volume**: Total bytes transferred in a session.
- Example of processed data:
  | Average Packet Size | Packet Rate | Protocol | Traffic Type | Label       |
  |---------------------|-------------|----------|--------------|-------------|
  | 450                 | 50 packets/s| TCP      | Streaming    | Streaming   |

---

#### **Step 3: Encoding and Scaling**
- **Encoding**:
  - Convert categorical features like `Protocol` or `Traffic Type` into numeric formats:
    - One-hot encoding: `TCP → [1, 0, 0], UDP → [0, 1, 0], ICMP → [0, 0, 1]`.
- **Scaling**:
  - Normalize numerical features like `Packet Size` or `Packet Rate` to a 0–1 range for better model performance.

---

#### **Step 4: Data Splitting**
- **Train/Test Split**:
  - Processed data is split into:
    - 80% for training the ML models.
    - 20% for testing and evaluating performance.
  - Example:
    - Training Set: Data from regular traffic patterns.
    - Testing Set: Includes edge cases (e.g., DoS simulation).

---

### **5. What Happens to the Processed Data?**
The cleaned, processed data is saved in `data/processed/` for various use cases:
1. **Training Machine Learning Models**:
   - Preprocessed data is passed to the LSTM and Decision Tree models for:
     - Predicting future traffic trends (LSTM).
     - Classifying traffic type (Decision Tree).
2. **Real-Time Predictions**:
   - Incoming traffic data is preprocessed on-the-fly (using the same pipeline) and fed to the deployed models via API calls.
3. **Monitoring**:
   - Aggregated metrics (e.g., average packet size, traffic rate) are sent to Prometheus for monitoring.

### **6. How Does the Data Flow in the System?**
Here’s an **end-to-end data flow** in the project:

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Raw data (e.g., `network_traffic.csv`) is captured and stored in `data/raw/`.
   - Real-time traffic data is ingested through API endpoints (e.g., `POST /traffic/classify`).

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - The `preprocess.py` script transforms raw data into feature-rich, clean datasets.
   - Processed data is stored in `data/processed/`.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Processed datasets are used to train ML models via the `train_model.py` script.
   - Trained models are saved and deployed to serve predictions.

4. **Real-Time Predictions**:
   - Incoming data goes through the same preprocessing pipeline in real time.
   - Processed features are passed to the deployed models, which return predictions via APIs.

5. **Monitoring and Feedback**:
   - Metrics from the preprocessing pipeline and model predictions (e.g., accuracy, latency) are sent to Prometheus.
   - Grafana dashboards visualize these metrics, helping detect anomalies or performance issues.

### **7. Key Data-Driven Insights**
By processing this data, your system can:
- **Classify Traffic**:
  - Identify patterns like streaming, browsing, or attacks in real time.
- **Predict Trends**:
  - Forecast traffic spikes or anomalies, enabling proactive resource optimization.
- **Optimize Resources**:
  - Use traffic predictions to adjust resource allocation dynamically.

### **Summary**
At the data level, this project takes raw, noisy network traffic data and transforms it into structured, meaningful information for machine learning models and monitoring systems. The pipeline ensures the data is:
1. **Clean and Organized**: Ready for training and predictions.
2. **Actionable**: Used to classify traffic and forecast trends.
3. **Monitored**: Evaluated for system performance and reliability.
