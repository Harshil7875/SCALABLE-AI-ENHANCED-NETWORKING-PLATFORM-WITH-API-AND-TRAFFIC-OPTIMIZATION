### **1. Overview of the API Design**
Your API acts as the interface between users or external systems and the platform. It has endpoints for:
1. **Traffic Management**:
   - Classify traffic types (e.g., streaming, browsing).
   - Predict traffic trends (using the LSTM model).
2. **Authentication**:
   - Secure access with JWT-based login and token validation.
3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Expose system and model performance data for monitoring tools like Prometheus.

These APIs are built with **FastAPI**, which provides:
- High performance via async support.
- Auto-generated documentation via Swagger (accessible at `/docs`).
- Easy-to-use routing, request validation, and security integration.

### **2. API Components**
Let’s dive into the key API components and how they work:

---

#### **2.1. Routing**
The **`routes/`** directory handles routing, mapping incoming HTTP requests to specific functions.

- **Structure**:
  ```plaintext
  api/
  ├── routes/
  │   ├── traffic.py     # Handles traffic-related endpoints
  │   ├── auth.py        # Manages authentication and token validation
  │   ├── metrics.py     # Exposes performance metrics for Prometheus
  │   └── __init__.py    # Combines routes into a unified API
  ```

- **Example Route (`traffic.py`)**:
  ```python
  from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
  from schemas.traffic import TrafficRequest, TrafficResponse
  from services.traffic_classifier import classify_traffic

  router = APIRouter()

  @router.post("/classify", response_model=TrafficResponse)
  async def classify(request: TrafficRequest):
      """Classify the type of network traffic."""
      classification = classify_traffic(request.features)
      return {"classification": classification}
  ```

  - **What Happens**:
    1. A POST request to `/classify` is routed to `classify_traffic`.
    2. The `request` is validated against the `TrafficRequest` schema.
    3. The `classify_traffic` function from `services/traffic_classifier.py` processes the request.
    4. The response is returned in the format defined by `TrafficResponse`.

---

#### **2.2. Schemas**
The **`schemas/`** directory defines the data models (Pydantic models) for:
- Validating incoming request data.
- Structuring outgoing response data.

- **Structure**:
  ```plaintext
  api/
  ├── schemas/
  │   ├── traffic.py      # Models for traffic classification requests/responses
  │   ├── auth.py         # Models for login and JWT token responses
  │   └── __init__.py     # Initialization
  ```

- **Example Schema (`traffic.py`)**:
  ```python
  from pydantic import BaseModel
  from typing import List

  class TrafficRequest(BaseModel):
      features: List[float]  # List of numeric features for classification

  class TrafficResponse(BaseModel):
      classification: str  # Predicted traffic type (e.g., Streaming, Browsing)
  ```

  - **What Happens**:
    - **Incoming Requests**:
      - Before reaching the route function, the data (e.g., `features`) is validated.
      - If the data doesn’t match the schema, an error response is automatically generated.
    - **Outgoing Responses**:
      - The API ensures responses adhere to the `TrafficResponse` structure.

---

#### **2.3. Services**
The **`services/`** directory contains the **business logic** of the API. This is where ML models are loaded, predictions are made, and authentication is handled.

- **Structure**:
  ```plaintext
  api/
  ├── services/
  │   ├── traffic_classifier.py  # Logic for traffic classification
  │   ├── auth_service.py        # JWT token generation/validation
  │   ├── resource_optimizer.py  # Handles resource allocation logic
  │   └── __init__.py            # Initialization
  ```

- **Example Service (`traffic_classifier.py`)**:
  ```python
  import pickle
  import numpy as np

  # Load the pre-trained decision tree model
  with open("models/decision_tree.pkl", "rb") as f:
      decision_tree = pickle.load(f)

  def classify_traffic(features: list) -> str:
      """Classify traffic based on features."""
      features = np.array(features).reshape(1, -1)  # Convert to 2D array
      prediction = decision_tree.predict(features)
      return prediction[0]  # Return the predicted traffic type
  ```

  - **What Happens**:
    1. The `classify_traffic` function receives `features` (validated earlier by the schema).
    2. The pre-trained Decision Tree model predicts the traffic type.
    3. The result is returned to the route function, which sends it back to the user.

---

#### **2.4. Utilities**
The **`utils/`** directory contains reusable utilities for logging, configuration, and helper functions.

- **Structure**:
  ```plaintext
  api/
  ├── utils/
  │   ├── logger.py      # Custom logger setup
  │   ├── config.py      # Environment variable management
  │   └── __init__.py    # Initialization
  ```

- **Example Utility (`config.py`)**:
  ```python
  import os
  from dotenv import load_dotenv

  # Load environment variables from .env file
  load_dotenv()

  # Access configuration values
  SECRET_KEY = os.getenv("SECRET_KEY")
  DATABASE_URL = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL")
  ```

  - **What Happens**:
    - The `config.py` utility loads environment variables (e.g., `SECRET_KEY`) and makes them accessible to other parts of the API.

---

#### **2.5. Main Application**
The **`main.py`** file ties everything together and starts the FastAPI app.

- **Example (`main.py`)**:
  ```python
  from fastapi import FastAPI
  from routes import traffic, auth, metrics

  app = FastAPI()

  # Include routers
  app.include_router(traffic.router, prefix="/traffic", tags=["Traffic"])
  app.include_router(auth.router, prefix="/auth", tags=["Authentication"])
  app.include_router(metrics.router, prefix="/metrics", tags=["Metrics"])
  ```

  - **What Happens**:
    1. Routers (`traffic.router`, `auth.router`, etc.) are included in the app with prefixes.
    2. When the app starts, the APIs are ready to handle requests.
    3. Swagger documentation (`/docs`) is auto-generated, listing all available routes.

---

### **3. Putting It All Together**
Here’s how everything works as a pipeline when a request hits the API:
1. **Request Handling**:
   - A user sends a request to an endpoint, e.g., `POST /traffic/classify`.
2. **Routing**:
   - The request is routed to the appropriate function (e.g., `classify()` in `traffic.py`).
3. **Schema Validation**:
   - The incoming data is validated against the `TrafficRequest` schema.
4. **Service Logic**:
   - The `classify_traffic()` function in `traffic_classifier.py` processes the request and calls the ML model.
5. **Response**:
   - The response is validated against the `TrafficResponse` schema and sent back to the user.
6. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - The API logs the request and response for debugging or performance monitoring.
